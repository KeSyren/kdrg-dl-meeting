# kdrg dl session
## Introduction
Since this session focuses on the DL / NLP, we assume the participants have solid machine learning background and know basics of deep learning.
The DL field contains tons of research topics. It isn't practical to randomly select topics to discuss, nor to present ABCs of DL step by step; otherwise even one semester is not enough. 

We recommend the people who is doing DL research right now to join in the the discussion, and we will discuss several interesting papers shortly after reviewing basics very briefly.

## Procedure
We discuss papers picked last week. We encourage everybody read the papers within one week, and comment on them in the following session. 
* warm-up - two or three sessions
  * briefly review concepts of DL to make sure everybody on the same page
  * materials: TBD
* paper discussion
  * mainly DL papers for NLP
